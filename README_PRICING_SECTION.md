## KRL Platform Access

These notebooks demonstrate methodologies implemented in the [Khipu Research Labs (KRL) platform](https://krlabs.dev)—a production infrastructure for causal inference and policy analysis. The platform eliminates common friction points: data acquisition (68+ authoritative connectors), environment management, computational scaling, and collaboration tools.

### What's Included

- **125+ Validated Causal Inference Estimators**: DID, RDD, synthetic controls, instrumental variables, spatial methods, heterogeneous treatment effects—all with unit tests and documentation
- **Zero Data Acquisition Overhead**: Direct integrations with Census Bureau, BLS, HUD, FHFA, and 64 other authoritative sources
- **Reproducible Environments**: Isolated execution contexts with locked dependencies—analyses run identically six months later
- **Collaboration Infrastructure**: Share workflows, review specifications, maintain audit trails without email ping-pong
- **Computational Scaling**: Run sensitivity analyses across thousands of specifications without thinking about infrastructure
