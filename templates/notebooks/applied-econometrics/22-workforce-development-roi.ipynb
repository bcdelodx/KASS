    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Workforce Development Evaluation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Workforce development programs face fundamental evaluation challenges that have led to decades of debate about their effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Selection Bias**\n",
    "- Participants self-select into training programs\n",
    "- Motivation, ability, and information access differ from non-participants\n",
    "- Simple comparisons overstate program effects (positive selection)\n",
    "- Or understate if programs target disadvantaged (negative selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Heterogeneous Effects**\n",
    "- Effects vary by participant characteristics, program quality, labor market conditions\n",
    "- Average treatment effects may mask important variation\n",
    "- Optimal targeting depends on who benefits most\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Multiple Outcomes Over Time**\n",
    "- Short-term: Credential completion, job placement\n",
    "- Medium-term: Employment retention, wage growth\n",
    "- Long-term: Career advancement, reduced public assistance\n",
    "- May show \"lock-in\" effects (negative short-term, positive long-term)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost-Benefit Imperative\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike pure academic research, workforce policy evaluation must answer practical questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Is the investment worth it?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires:\n",
    "1. **Causal Impact Estimates:** What outcomes would participants have achieved anyway?\n",
    "2. **Benefit Valuation:** What is the dollar value of employment and earnings gains?\n",
    "3. **Cost Accounting:** What are the full costs of program delivery?\n",
    "4. **Perspective Clarity:** From whose perspective (participant, government, society)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Workforce program evaluation has evolved through several eras:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Era | Method | Key Finding |\n",
    "|-----|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1970s-80s | Experimental (JTPA studies) | Modest effects, women benefit more |\n",
    "| 1990s | Quasi-experimental (WIA) | Mixed results, implementation matters |\n",
    "| 2000s | RCTs (HPOG, Year Up) | Sector programs show promise |\n",
    "| 2010s-Present | Administrative data | Big data enables better selection correction |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses four evaluation questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question | Method | Metric |\n",
    "|----------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| 1. Does training increase employment? | PSM + AIPW | Employment rate (ppt change) |\n",
    "| 2. Does training increase earnings? | PSM + AIPW | Quarterly earnings ($) |\n",
    "| 3. Are benefits > costs? | CBA framework | NPV, BCR |\n",
    "| 4. Who benefits most? | Subgroup analysis | CATE by demographics |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simulation-based approach calibrated to real labor market conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real Data (FRED):**\n",
    "- National unemployment rate\n",
    "- Median weekly earnings\n",
    "- Labor force participation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulated Data (Calibrated):**\n",
    "- Individual-level demographics\n",
    "- Program participation (with realistic selection)\n",
    "- Employment and earnings outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows demonstration of full methodology while highlighting what would change with real administrative data.\n",

    "## Identification Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Causal Estimand\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to estimate the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)** of workforce program participation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau^{ATT} = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | D_i = 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $Y_i(1)$: Outcome for individual $i$ if they participate in training (observed for participants)\n",
    "- $Y_i(0)$: Outcome for individual $i$ if they do *not* participate (counterfactual)\n",
    "- $D_i = 1$: Individual participated in workforce development program\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of interest:\n",
    "- **Employment:** Binary indicator of employment at follow-up\n",
    "- **Earnings:** Quarterly earnings in dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identification Assumption: Selection on Observables\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that conditional on observed covariates $X$, treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(0), Y(1) \\perp D | X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also known as **conditional unconfoundedness** or **ignorability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** After controlling for demographics, baseline employment history, skills, and local labor market conditions, remaining differences between participants and non-participants are *as good as random*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Assumption May Be Violated\n",
    "\n",
    "| Potential Confounder | Observed? | Concern |\n",
    "|---------------------|-----------|---------|\n",
    "| Demographics (age, gender, race) | ✅ Yes | Controlled |\n",
    "| Education level | ✅ Yes | Controlled |\n",
    "| Baseline employment | ✅ Yes | Controlled |\n",
    "| Local unemployment rate | ✅ Yes | Controlled |\n",
    "| **Motivation/soft skills** | ❌ No | May bias upward |\n",
    "| **Ability/learning speed** | ❌ No | May bias upward |\n",
    "| **Health conditions** | ❌ No | Direction unclear |\n",
    "| **Social networks** | ❌ No | May bias upward |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concern:** If participants have higher unobserved motivation or ability, estimates will be *upward biased* (overstating program effectiveness).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlap/Positivity Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "For valid estimation, we require that all individuals have positive probability of both treatment and control:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 < P(D = 1 | X) < 1 \\quad \\forall X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Check:** Examine propensity score distributions. Extreme scores (near 0 or 1) indicate poor overlap and unreliable extrapolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimation Strategy: Augmented IPW (AIPW)\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement the **Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted (AIPW)** estimator, which is doubly robust:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\tau}^{AIPW} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\hat{\\mu}_1(X_i) - \\hat{\\mu}_0(X_i) + \\frac{D_i(Y_i - \\hat{\\mu}_1(X_i))}{\\hat{e}(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i)(Y_i - \\hat{\\mu}_0(X_i))}{1-\\hat{e}(X_i)} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{e}(X_i)$: Estimated propensity score\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\mu}_d(X_i)$: Estimated outcome mean conditional on $X$ and treatment $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double Robustness:** Consistent if *either* the propensity score model *or* the outcome model is correctly specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Propensity Score Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate treatment probability using logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{logit}(P(D_i = 1 | X_i)) = X_i'\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariates included:\n",
    "- **Demographics:** Age, gender, race/ethnicity, veteran status\n",
    "- **Human Capital:** Education level, prior earnings\n",
    "- **Barriers:** Disability status, single parent status\n",
    "- **Labor Market:** Local unemployment rate at baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Since unconfoundedness cannot be tested, we should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calibrated Confounding:** Bound bias under assumed confounder strength\n",
    "2. **Alternative Specifications:** Vary propensity score and outcome models\n",
    "3. **Subgroup Stability:** Check if effects are consistent across subpopulations\n",
    "4. **External Validation:** Compare to experimental benchmarks when available\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Identify vs. What We Assume\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Status | Notes |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-------|\n",
    "| ATT under unconfoundedness | ✅ Identified | Point estimates and CIs |\n",
    "| ATE (for non-participants) | ⚠️ Requires overlap | May extrapolate poorly |\n",
    "| Mechanisms | ❌ Not identified | Cannot distinguish training effect from signaling |\n",
    "| Long-term effects | ⚠️ Assumed persistent | Applied decay rate may be wrong |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Experimental Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "AIPW estimates can be benchmarked against RCT findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Program | RCT Finding | Our Approach |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Year Up | +$1,895 annual earnings | Compare magnitude |\n",
    "| HPOG | +4-5 ppt employment | Compare magnitude |\n",
    "| JTPA | Modest effects, women > men | Check heterogeneity |\n",
    "\n",

    "## Limitations & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Propensity-Weighted Treatment Effects**\n",
    "   - ATT estimates under selection-on-observables identification\n",
    "   - Doubly-robust confidence intervals\n",
    "   - Comparison of treated vs. matched control outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost-Benefit Framework**\n",
    "   - NPV and BCR calculations using standard methods\n",
    "   - Participant and societal benefit perspectives\n",
    "   - Sensitivity to discount rate and benefit horizon\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distributional Heterogeneity**\n",
    "   - Effects across demographic subgroups\n",
    "   - Quantile treatment effects\n",
    "   - Who benefits most from training\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Welfare Implications**\n",
    "   - Social welfare function analysis\n",
    "   - Gini coefficient changes\n",
    "   - Equity-efficiency tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES NOT Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Causal Effects (if unconfoundedness fails)**\n",
    "   - Selection on unobservables (motivation, ability) may bias estimates\n",
    "   - Upward bias likely if participants are positively selected\n",
    "   - Sensitivity analysis cannot definitively rule out bias\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Program Mechanisms**\n",
    "   - Is it skills acquisition or credential signaling?\n",
    "   - Is it job placement services or training content?\n",
    "   - Cannot distinguish human capital from screening effects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Long-Term Persistence**\n",
    "   - Effects may grow (skill complementarities) or fade (depreciation)\n",
    "   - 15% annual decay is assumed, not estimated\n",
    "   - 5-year horizon may miss important dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **General Equilibrium Effects**\n",
    "   - What if everyone received training?\n",
    "   - Displacement of non-participants\n",
    "   - Wage effects if labor supply shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Program Quality Variation**\n",
    "   - Effects may vary enormously across providers\n",
    "   - \"Average\" effect mixes good and poor programs\n",
    "   - Quality improvement may be more important than expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threats to Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Threat | Concern | Mitigation | Severity |\n",
    "|--------|---------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| Unobserved confounding | Motivation/ability bias | Rich covariates, sensitivity analysis | HIGH |\n",
    "| Measurement error | Self-reported earnings | Use UI wage records in production | MODERATE |\n",
    "| Attrition | Differential follow-up | Check balanced sample | LOW |\n",
    "| Interference | Spillovers between participants | Cluster standard errors | LOW |\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concern | Limitation |\n",
    "|---------|------------|\n",
    "| Simulated data | Real PIRL data may show different effects |\n",
    "| Current labor market | Effects vary with economic conditions |\n",
    "| Specific program | Results don't generalize to all programs |\n",
    "| Demographics | Sample may not represent target population |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Misinterpretations to AVOID\n",
    "\n",
    "| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |\n",
    "|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| \"The program definitely works\" | \"Under our assumptions, effects are positive\" |\n",
    "| \"Everyone should receive training\" | \"Average effects may mask heterogeneity\" |\n",
    "| \"ROI of 3:1 proves cost-effectiveness\" | \"ROI is sensitive to assumptions about benefit duration\" |\n",
    "| \"Expand this exact program\" | \"Effects may not scale; implementation matters\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity Analysis Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cinelli-Hazlett Bounds:** Formalize bias from unobserved confounding\n",
    "2. **Alternative Matching:** k-nearest neighbors, caliper matching, full matching\n",
    "3. **Outcome Models:** Random forest, LASSO, ensemble methods\n",
    "4. **Discount Rates:** Test 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%\n",
    "5. **Benefit Horizons:** 3, 5, 10 years with varying decay rates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Experimental Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "| Benchmark | RCT Finding | Our Estimate | Interpretation |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Year Up | +$1,895/year | [Compare] | If much larger, selection bias |\n",
    "| HPOG | +4-5 ppt employment | [Compare] | Magnitude check |\n",
    "| JTPA | Modest effects | [Compare] | Order of magnitude |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducibility Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Seed:** RANDOM_SEED = 42 (in data generation and propensity model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Simulation:** Results are generated from a known DGP with programmed selection and treatment effects. Actual administrative data would yield different estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Parameters:** Direct costs only; overhead allocation would increase costs. Indirect costs (foregone earnings during training) not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit Valuation:** Earnings gains valued at face value; no adjustments for taxes or transfers."
