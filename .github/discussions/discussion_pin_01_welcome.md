# 👋 Welcome to KASS Discussions! Start Here

Whether you're here to learn causal inference, solve a specific analytical problem, or contribute to better policy analysis infrastructure, you're in the right place.

## What This Community Is About

We're building a practice around rigorous policy evaluation. That means:
- **Honest methods**: We discuss what works, what doesn't, and what the limitations are
- **Practical applications**: Real problems, real data, real constraints
- **Collaborative learning**: Everyone has something to teach and something to learn
- **High standards**: We care about getting it right, not getting it done fast

## How to Get the Most Out of Discussions

**Ask good questions:**
- Be specific about your analytical problem
- Share relevant context (data structure, policy question, constraints)
- Show what you've already tried
- Accept that "it depends" is often the honest answer

**Provide good answers:**
- Cite sources when making methodological claims
- Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations
- Explain reasoning, don't just give code
- Be kind to people learning

**Share your work:**
- Post in Show & Tell when you've built something using KASS
- We love seeing novel applications
- Helps others learn what's possible

**Request thoughtfully:**
- Check existing issues/discussions before suggesting new features
- Explain the use case, not just the feature
- Understand that "no" often means "not yet" rather than "never"

## Community Standards

**We welcome:**
- Methodological debates (with evidence and civility)
- Questions at any level (we were all beginners once)
- Critiques of methods or code (that's how we improve)
- Sharing of work that uses KASS (that's what it's for)

**We don't tolerate:**
- Personal attacks or disrespectful language
- Promotion of methodologically unsound practices
- Spam or off-topic commercial promotion
- Requests to do someone's analysis for them

## About the Maintainers

KASS is developed by KR Labs as an open-source demonstration of methods that power the [KRL platform](https://krlabs.dev). We actively maintain this repository because we believe better policy analysis infrastructure benefits everyone.

We're here to:
- Answer methodological questions
- Review contributions
- Fix bugs and improve documentation
- Learn from your applications

We're not here to:
- Do your analysis for you
- Provide free consulting
- Guarantee specific feature delivery timelines
