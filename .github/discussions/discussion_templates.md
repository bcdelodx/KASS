## Template 1: Methodological Question

Use this when asking about causal inference methods, identification strategies, or analytical approach.

```markdown
## Context
[What policy question are you trying to answer? Be specific.]

## Your Analytical Setup

- **Treatment:** [What's the intervention/policy you're evaluating?]
- **Outcome:** [What are you measuring?]
- **Data structure:** [Panel? Cross-section? Time periods? Comparison units?]
- **Identification concern:** [What threatens causal inference here?]

## Your Question
[Your specific methodological question]

## What You've Tried
[What approaches have you considered? Why are they insufficient?]

## Ideal Answer Format
[Do you need: conceptual explanation, code example, paper references, or all three?]
```

## Template 2: Implementation Help

Use this when you're having technical problems running KASS notebooks.

```markdown
## What I'm Trying to Do
[Clear description of your goal]

## My Setup

- **Notebook:** [Which KASS notebook are you using? Include link]
- **Python version:** [e.g., 3.9.7]
- **Operating system:** [MacOS/Linux/Windows + version]
- **Environment:** [Jupyter/Colab/VS Code/JupyterLab/etc.]

## What's Happening

[Describe the error, unexpected output, or behavior]

```python
# Paste relevant code snippet here
# Include the cell that's failing
```

**Error message** (if applicable):
```
[Paste the complete error traceback]
```

## What I've Tried
[List the debugging steps you've already taken]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen instead?]
```

## Template 3: Show & Tell

Use this when sharing your work that uses KASS methods.

```markdown
## Policy Question
[What were you evaluating?]

## Method Used
[Which KASS notebook(s) did you adapt?]

## Key Methodological Decisions

- [Decision 1 and rationale]
- [Decision 2 and rationale]
- [Decision 3 and rationale]

## Results Summary
[What did you find? Include:
- Effect magnitudes
- Statistical significance
- Robustness check results
- Heterogeneity if applicable]

## What You Learned

[Share insights about:
- Methodological pitfalls you avoided
- Surprises in the data or results
- Implementation challenges
- What you'd do differently next time]

## Output/Impact
[What happened with the analysis? 
- Published paper?
- Internal report?
- Policy decision?
- Work in progress?]

## Links (Optional)

## Template 4: Feature Request

Use this when suggesting new notebooks, methods, or improvements.

```markdown
## The Need
[What analytical problem exists that KASS doesn't currently solve?
Be specific about the use case.]

## Proposed Solution
[What notebook/method/feature would address this?]

## Use Cases
[Where would this be applied? 
- Which policy domains?
- Which organizations would benefit?
- How common is this need?]

## Alternatives Considered
[Could existing notebooks be adapted? Why not?
What workarounds are people currently using?]

## I Can Help By

- [ ] Writing the notebook myself
- [ ] Providing domain expertise
- [ ] Testing the implementation
- [ ] Reviewing the methodology
- [ ] Writing documentation
- [ ] Just suggesting the idea

[If you checked any boxes, describe your relevant background]
```

## Template 5: General Discussion

Use this for broader conversations about policy analysis, research practices, or the field.

```markdown
## Topic
[What do you want to discuss?]

## Why This Matters
[Why is this relevant to the KASS community?]

## Questions to Explore

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

## Tips for Getting Good Responses

**DO:**
- Be specific about your situation
- Show what you've already tried
- Include relevant details (data structure, constraints, context)
- Format code properly with markdown code blocks
- Use clear, descriptive titles for your discussion

**DON'T:**
- Ask multiple unrelated questions in one post
- Share confidential or sensitive information
- Expect others to do your analysis for you
- Post without checking the FAQ first
- Use vague titles like "Need help" or "Question"
