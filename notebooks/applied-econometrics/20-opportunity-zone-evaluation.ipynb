    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **place-based policy evaluation** using the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Opportunity Zone (OZ) program as a case study. We apply quasi-experimental methods to estimate the impact of OZ designation on local economic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Selection Analysis** - Understand how tracts were designated as Opportunity Zones\n",
    "2.  **Difference-in-Differences** - Apply DiD to estimate OZ treatment effects\n",
    "3.  **Propensity Score Methods** - Account for selection on observables\n",
    "4.  **Spatial Econometrics** - Model spillover effects to neighboring tracts\n",
    "5.  **Displacement Analysis** - Test for adverse effects on residents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",

    "\n",
    "### Policy Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Opportunity Zone program designated ~8,700 low-income census tracts for tax-advantaged investment. Key policy questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Did OZ designation increase investment flows?\n",
    "2. Did investment translate to improved economic outcomes for residents?\n",
    "3. Did investment displace existing residents (gentrification)?\n",
    "4. What are the spillover effects on non-designated neighbors?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.9+\n",
    "- KRL Suite Professional Tier (for spatial analysis)\n",
    "- FRED API key\n",
    "- Understanding of difference-in-differences methodology\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Place-Based Policy Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Place-based economic development policies—programs that target specific geographic areas for investment—face fundamental evaluation challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Selection Bias**\n",
    "- Areas are selected based on observed characteristics (poverty, unemployment)\n",
    "- Selected areas may have different trajectories regardless of treatment\n",
    "- Simple before/after comparisons confound treatment with selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Spatial Interdependence**\n",
    "- Treated areas interact with untreated neighbors\n",
    "- Investment may spill over or displace\n",
    "- SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) may be violated\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Multiple Outcomes**\n",
    "- Investment metrics (QOF fund flows)\n",
    "- Economic outcomes (employment, income)\n",
    "- Resident welfare (housing costs, displacement)\n",
    "- May show positive effects on some outcomes but harm on others\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Opportunity Zone Natural Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2017 OZ program offers unique evaluation opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Eligibility-Based Designation:**\n",
    "- Governors selected ~25% of *eligible* low-income tracts\n",
    "- Creates natural comparison group: eligible but not designated\n",
    "- Selection decision somewhat discretionary, creating variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Staggered Rollout:**\n",
    "- Initial designations in April 2018\n",
    "- Investment flows ramp up through 2019-2021\n",
    "- Allows event study analysis of dynamic effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observable Selection Criteria:**\n",
    "- Low-income census tract status is deterministic\n",
    "- Can construct similar eligible comparison tracts\n",
    "- Propensity score methods address remaining selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses four policy questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question | Method | Outcome |\n",
    "|----------|--------|---------|\n",
    "| 1. Did OZ increase investment? | DiD | QOF fund flows |\n",
    "| 2. Did investment improve outcomes? | DiD with weighting | Unemployment rate |\n",
    "| 3. Did OZ displace residents? | DiD | Housing costs, poverty |\n",
    "| 4. Did benefits spill to neighbors? | Spatial DiD | Neighbor outcomes |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings from existing OZ research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chen, Glaeser & Wessel (2019):** Early evidence of modest investment effects\n",
    "- **Arefeva et al. (2021):** OZ increased property values, mixed employment effects\n",
    "- **Freedman et al. (2021):** Some evidence of gentrification in certain markets\n",
    "- **Sage et al. (2022):** Heterogeneous effects by urban/rural status\n",

    "\n",
    "### Causal Estimand\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to estimate the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)** of Opportunity Zone designation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau^{ATT} = E[Y_{i,post}(1) - Y_{i,post}(0) | D_i = 1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $Y_{i,post}(1)$: Outcome for tract $i$ in post-period if designated (observed)\n",
    "- $Y_{i,post}(0)$: Outcome for tract $i$ in post-period if *not* designated (counterfactual)\n",
    "- $D_i = 1$: Tract was designated as Opportunity Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference-in-Differences Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate the ATT using the canonical two-period DiD model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{it} = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Treated}_i + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Post}_t + \\tau^{DiD} \\cdot (\\text{Treated}_i \\times \\text{Post}_t) + \\epsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The DiD estimator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\tau}^{DiD} = \\underbrace{(\\bar{Y}_{T,post} - \\bar{Y}_{T,pre})}_{\\text{Change in treated}} - \\underbrace{(\\bar{Y}_{C,post} - \\bar{Y}_{C,pre})}_{\\text{Change in control}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 1: Parallel Trends** ⚠️ CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of OZ designation, treated and control tracts would have followed parallel outcome trajectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[Y_{i,post}(0) - Y_{i,pre}(0) | D_i = 1] = E[Y_{i,post}(0) - Y_{i,pre}(0) | D_i = 0]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testability:** While we cannot directly test this (the counterfactual is unobserved), we can:\n",
    "1. Examine pre-treatment trends for divergence\n",
    "2. Conduct placebo tests in pre-periods\n",
    "3. Use propensity score matching to improve comparability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 2: No Anticipation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracts did not change behavior in anticipation of OZ designation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_{i,pre}(1) = Y_{i,pre}(0) \\quad \\forall i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plausibility:** OZ designations were announced in April 2018. If investors began positioning before announcement, pre-period outcomes may be contaminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 3: SUTVA (Modified for Spillovers)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard SUTVA requires no interference between units. We *relax* this to explicitly model spillovers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = Y_i(D_i, \\bar{D}_{-i})$$\n",

    "## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. County-Level Aggregation Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The actual Opportunity Zone program operates at the CENSUS TRACT level, not the county level.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Attenuation bias**: County-level aggregation averages treated tracts with non-treated tracts, diluting true effects\n",
    "- **Ecological fallacy risk**: County-level patterns may not reflect tract-level relationships\n",
    "- **Selection misspecification**: Our simulated designation is at county level, while real OZ selection was based on tract-level eligibility criteria\n",
    "- **Compounded bias in ROI**: County-level aggregation affects both treatment effect estimation AND benefit valuation, compounding the bias in any cost-benefit or ROI calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Concern:**\n",
    "- Average PA county contains ~15-30 census tracts\n",
    "- Only ~10-20% of tracts in a county may be designated OZ\n",
    "- County-level analysis captures spillover-weighted average, not direct effect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Remediation:**\n",
    "- Use actual tract-level OZ designations from CDFI Fund\n",
    "- Match treated tracts to similar non-treated tracts (within-county or cross-county)\n",
    "- Estimate tract-level DiD with county fixed effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pre-Programmed Home Value Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Home value outcomes are artifacts of data generation, not empirical findings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data generation process explicitly programs an 8% OZ premium:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oz_effect_pct = np.where(oz_data['designated_oz'] == 1, 0.08, 0)  # 8% OZ premium\n",
    "oz_data['home_value_2022'] = oz_data['home_value_2016'] * (1 + base_appreciation + oz_effect_pct + ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:** Any analysis \"discovering\" an 8% home value effect is circular reasoning—the effect was programmed, not estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Valid Uses:**\n",
    "- Demonstrating DiD mechanics\n",
    "- Teaching propensity score methods\n",
    "- Illustrating spatial econometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invalid Uses:**\n",
    "- Drawing conclusions about actual OZ home value effects\n",
    "- Comparing to published OZ housing research\n",
    "- Informing policy decisions\n",

    "## Limitations & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Difference-in-Differences Estimates**\n",
    "   - ATT of OZ-style designation on county unemployment\n",
    "   - Confidence intervals accounting for estimation uncertainty\n",
    "   - Comparison of treated and control county trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selection Patterns**\n",
    "   - Which characteristics predict designation\n",
    "   - Propensity score distribution for balance assessment\n",
    "   - Covariate overlap between treated and control\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spatial Patterns**\n",
    "   - Geographic clustering of treated areas\n",
    "   - Potential for spillover effects\n",
    "   - Visualization of treatment geography\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pre-Trend Assessment**\n",
    "   - Whether parallel trends assumption is plausible\n",
    "   - Divergence patterns before treatment\n",
    "   - Placebo effect estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES NOT Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definitive Causal Effects (if parallel trends fails)**\n",
    "   - DiD relies on untestable counterfactual assumption\n",
    "   - Pre-trend tests are necessary but not sufficient\n",
    "   - Selection on time-varying unobservables remains possible\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tract-Level Effects**\n",
    "   - County-level analysis masks within-county heterogeneity\n",
    "   - Actual OZ program operates at census tract level\n",
    "   - Aggregation may attenuate effects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Investment Flows**\n",
    "   - We measure employment outcomes, not investment inputs\n",
    "   - Cannot distinguish investment channel from other mechanisms\n",
    "   - QOF fund data required for complete evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Long-Term Effects**\n",
    "   - OZ program is still young (implemented 2018)\n",
    "   - Economic development effects may take years to materialize\n",
    "   - Effects may grow or fade over time\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Distributional Effects**\n",
    "   - Who benefits from OZ investment?\n",
    "   - Are existing residents helped or displaced?\n",
    "   - Requires individual-level or tract-level data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threats to Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Threat | Concern | Evidence | Severity |\n",
    "|--------|---------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Non-parallel trends | Treated/control may have diverged anyway | Check pre-trends | HIGH |\n",
    "| Anticipation | Investors positioned before announcement | Use 2016 baseline | LOW |\n",
    "| Spillovers | Treatment affects controls | Spatial DiD results | MODERATE |\n",
    "| Attrition | Differential missing data | Check balanced panel | LOW |\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Validity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concern | Limitation |\n",
    "|---------|------------|\n",
    "| Pennsylvania only | Effects may differ in other states |\n",
    "| County-level | Tract-level effects may differ |\n",
    "| 2016-2022 only | Longer-term effects unknown |\n",
    "| Unemployment focus | Other outcomes (investment, rents) not analyzed |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appropriate Uses of This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Appropriate:**\n",
    "- Understanding DiD methodology for place-based policy evaluation\n",
    "- Learning to implement propensity score weighting\n",
    "- Exploring spatial econometrics with spillovers\n",
    "- Generating hypotheses about OZ effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Not Appropriate:**\n",
    "- Definitive claims about OZ program effectiveness\n",
    "- Policy recommendations without additional validation\n",
    "- Cost-benefit analysis (requires more outcomes)\n",
    "- Generalizing to other states or tract-level effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity Analysis Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-trend Tests:** Implement formal tests (Roth 2022)\n",
    "2. **Alternative Controls:** Vary propensity score model\n",
    "3. **Placebo Treatments:** Assign \"fake\" OZ in pre-period\n",
    "4. **Spatial Weights:** Test sensitivity to distance definitions\n",
    "5. **Subgroup Analysis:** Urban vs. rural counties\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reproducibility Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Seed:** RANDOM_SEED = 42 (for propensity model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Vintage:** FRED county unemployment data as of analysis date. Results may differ with revised data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Definitions:** K=3 nearest neighbors for spillover analysis. Results may vary with alternative spatial weight matrices."
