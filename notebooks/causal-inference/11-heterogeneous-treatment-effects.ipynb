    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)** estimation for understanding how policy effects vary across subgroups. We combine AIPW for population-level inference with Causal Forests for individual-level heterogeneity discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **CATE Estimation** - Estimate how treatment effects vary by observed characteristics\n",
    "2.  **AIPW Implementation** - Apply doubly-robust methods for average treatment effects\n",
    "3.  **Causal Forest** - Use machine learning for treatment effect heterogeneity\n",
    "4.  **Subgroup Discovery** - Identify groups with systematically larger or smaller effects\n",
    "5.  **Policy Targeting** - Design targeting rules based on predicted treatment effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Purpose | KRL Component |\n",
    "|--------|---------|---------------|\n",
    "| AIPW Estimator | Doubly-robust ATE | `TreatmentEffectEstimator` |\n",
    "| Causal Forest | Individual-level CATE | `CausalForest` (Pro) |\n",
    "| Variable Importance | Identify effect moderators | Feature importance metrics |\n",
    "| Subgroup Analysis | Compare effects across groups | Stratified estimation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Question:** How do the effects of economic policies vary across different states, demographic groups, and baseline conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "- Treatment effects vary substantially across states with different economic baselines\n",
    "- Manufacturing-heavy states show larger effects than service-based economies\n",
    "- Geographic region (Midwest/South vs. Coasts) moderates policy effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.9+\n",
    "- KRL Suite Pro Tier (for Causal Forest)\n",
    "- FRED API key\n",
    "- Understanding of propensity score methods\n",

    "### Why This Question Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Policies rarely have uniform effects across all recipients. A job training program may substantially benefit workers in declining industries while providing minimal gains for those already in growing sectors. Tax incentives may stimulate investment in some regions but have no effect in others. Understanding *who* benefits from a policy\u2014and by how much\u2014is essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Targeting:** Directing limited resources to populations where effects are largest\n",
    "2. **Equity:** Ensuring policies don't exacerbate existing disparities\n",
    "3. **Generalization:** Predicting effects in new contexts based on their characteristics\n",
    "4. **Mechanism Discovery:** Understanding why policies work (or don't)\n",
    "\n",
    "The average treatment effect (ATE) masks this heterogeneity. A policy with an ATE of zero may have large positive effects for some groups offset by large negative effects for others\u2014a critically important pattern that population averages obscure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Causal Inference Is Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing that outcomes vary by subgroup doesn't establish heterogeneous treatment effects. Selection bias may cause more motivated individuals to select into treatment *and* have better outcomes\u2014conflating treatment effect heterogeneity with baseline heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) require the same identification strategies as ATEs\u2014randomization, selection on observables, instrumental variables, or quasi-experimental designs\u2014applied within subgroups or conditioned on covariates. Machine learning methods like Causal Forests can estimate individual-level treatment effects while respecting causal identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution to Policy Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- AIPW estimation for robust average effects\n",
    "- Causal Forest estimation for individual treatment effect heterogeneity\n",
    "- Subgroup analysis with proper hypothesis testing\n",
    "- Best practices for avoiding false discoveries in subgroup analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods align with Athey & Wager (2019), Chernozhukov et al. (2018), and Kennedy (2020)."

    "## Identification Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causal Question:** How does the effect of economic policy interventions vary across states with different baseline characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Estimand:** The Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE):\n",
    "$$\\tau(x) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | X = x]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ represents state characteristics (baseline unemployment, industry composition, region).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:** If effects are heterogeneous, targeting policies to high-effect subgroups improves efficiency. If effects are uniform, simpler universal policies may be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What variation identifies the effect?**\n",
    "This analysis uses selection-on-observables (conditional independence) for identification. Treatment assignment is assumed independent of potential outcomes conditional on observed covariates including state economic indicators, demographics, and policy history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this variation credible?**\n",
    "For observational HTE analysis, credibility depends on:\n",
    "1. Rich set of pre-treatment covariates capturing selection into treatment\n",
    "2. AIPW doubly-robust estimation providing some protection against model misspecification\n",
    "3. Honest inference methods (Causal Forest) that don't exploit outcome data for tree splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 1: Conditional Unconfoundedness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Statement:**\n",
    "$$Y(0), Y(1) \\perp D | X$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain Language:** \n",
    "Treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes, conditional on observed covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Might Hold:**\n",
    "Comprehensive covariates (economic indicators, demographics, policy history) may capture the main sources of selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity if Violated:**\n",
    "CRITICAL - Omitted variable bias will contaminate both ATE and CATE estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 2: Overlap / Common Support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Statement:**\n",

    "For every covariate profile, there are both treated and control units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How We Test This:**\n",
    "- Propensity score distribution by treatment status\n",
    "- Overlap diagnostics and trimming if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity if Violated:**\n",
    "CRITICAL for affected regions - Cannot estimate CATEs where no treated (or control) units exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumption 3: Honest Splitting (Causal Forest)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Statement:**\n",
    "Tree splits are determined using only covariates, not outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain Language:** \n",
    "The algorithm doesn't \"peek\" at outcomes when deciding how to partition the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Holds:**\n",
    "Causal Forest uses \"honest\" estimation: separate samples for tree-building and treatment effect estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threats to Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threat 1: Unmeasured Confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** \n",
    "State-level policies may be adopted in response to unobserved factors that also affect outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity:** MAJOR\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence:**\n",
    "Cannot directly test; sensitivity analysis required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:** \n",
    "Include rich baseline covariates; use doubly-robust estimation; interpret as associations if confounding is suspected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threat 2: Multiple Comparisons (Subgroup Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** \n",
    "Testing many subgroups inflates false discovery rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity:** MODERATE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "- Pre-specify subgroups based on theory\n",
    "- Use honest splitting methods (Causal Forest)\n",
    "- Apply multiple testing corrections\n",
    "- Replicate in held-out data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threat 3: Selection into Subgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** \n",
    "Subgroup membership may be endogenous (e.g., states choose industry composition based on expected policy effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Severity:** MINOR (for baseline characteristics)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mitigation:**\n",
    "Use baseline (pre-treatment) characteristics for subgroup definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-specified Tests:**\n",
    "- [x] Propensity score overlap diagnostics\n",
    "- [x] Covariate balance (overall and within subgroups)\n",
    "- [x] Cross-validation for CATE model performance\n",
    "- [x] Comparison of CATE methods (consistency check)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n",
    "- Propensity scores bounded away from 0 and 1\n",
    "- Standardized mean differences < 0.1 after weighting\n",
    "- Cross-validated R\u00b2 > 0 for CATE prediction\n",
    "- Method agreement: correlation > 0.5 across CATE estimators"

    "## Limitations & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population-Level Average Treatment Effects**\n",
    "   - AIPW provides doubly-robust ATE estimates\n",
    "   - Confidence intervals account for estimation uncertainty\n",
    "   - Comparison to ground truth validates estimation performance (in simulated data)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Treatment Effect Heterogeneity Patterns**\n",
    "   - Causal Forest identifies covariates associated with larger/smaller effects\n",
    "   - Variable importance rankings guide subgroup discovery\n",
    "   - Cross-validated predictions assess generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subgroup-Specific Effects**\n",
    "   - Effects estimated separately for pre-specified subgroups\n",
    "   - Statistical tests compare subgroup effects\n",
    "   - Visualization of heterogeneity across key dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Analysis DOES NOT Show\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Causal Effects (Without Experiments)**\n",
    "   - Selection-on-observables identification requires unconfoundedness\n",
    "   - Unmeasured confounding would bias both ATE and CATE estimates\n",
    "   - Interpret as \"conditional associations\" if confounding is suspected\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optimal Targeting Rules**\n",
    "   - CATE estimates inform targeting but don't determine optimal policy\n",
    "   - Cost-effectiveness requires additional economic analysis\n",
    "   - Implementation constraints may limit targeting feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mechanism of Heterogeneity**\n",
    "   - We identify *which* subgroups have larger effects, not *why*\n",
    "   - Mechanism analysis requires additional theory and data\n",
    "   - Correlates of heterogeneity may not be causal\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effects Beyond Observed Data**\n",
    "   - Cannot extrapolate to populations outside the data support\n",
    "   - Time-varying effects not captured in cross-sectional analysis\n",
    "   - External validity requires replication in new contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threats to Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unmeasured Confounding:** Severity = CRITICAL\n",
    "   - **Evidence:** Cannot directly test; correlates of treatment may be omitted\n",
    "   - **Mitigation:** Include rich covariates; use doubly-robust estimation\n",
    "   - **Residual Concern:** Selection into treatment based on unobservables\n",
    "   - **Impact:** Both ATE and CATE estimates may be biased\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overfitting in CATE Estimation:** Severity = MODERATE\n",
    "   - **Evidence:** Complex ML models may overfit to noise\n",
    "   - **Mitigation:** Cross-validation; honest splitting; regularization\n",
    "   - **Residual Concern:** Apparent heterogeneity may be spurious\n",
    "   - **Impact:** Confidence intervals may undercover; replication essential\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Comparisons:** Severity = MODERATE\n",
    "   - **Evidence:** Many subgroups tested increases false positive rate\n",
    "   - **Mitigation:** Pre-specify subgroups; adjust for multiplicity; replicate\n",
    "   - **Residual Concern:** Some \"significant\" subgroup differences may be chance\n",
    "   - **Impact:** Use as hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Validity Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population Scope:**\n",
    "- Analysis uses simulated individual-level data calibrated to real state-level FRED data\n",
    "- Effects may differ for actual individual-level data with more variation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal Scope:**\n",
    "- Cross-sectional analysis at one point in time\n",
    "- Dynamic treatment effects over time not captured\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geographic Scope:**\n",
    "- U.S. states only; may not generalize internationally\n",
    "- Urban/rural heterogeneity not captured at state level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Scope:**\n",
    "- Generic \"economic policy intervention\" simulated\n",
    "- Effects of specific real policies may differ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain Individual-Level Data**\n",
    "   - Administrative records or survey data with treatment and outcomes\n",
    "   - Richer covariate information for heterogeneity analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Experimental Validation**\n",
    "   - RCT testing treatment in high-predicted-effect subgroups\n",
    "   - Compare experimental effects to observational CATE predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity Analysis**\n",
    "   - Implement Cinelli & Hazlett (2020) sensitivity for unmeasured confounding\n",
    "   - Bound treatment effects under plausible confounding scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Policy Simulation**\n",
    "   - Cost-benefit analysis incorporating CATE estimates\n",
    "   - Optimal targeting rules under budget constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mechanism Investigation**\n",
    "   - Mediation analysis to understand *why* effects differ\n",
    "   - Qualitative research on implementation variation"
